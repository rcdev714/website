## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is Play Mode?

Play Mode is a risk-free way to test your prediction skills. You are given a
starting balance of virtual tokens to wager on markets. These tokens have no
real-world value.

### Can I withdraw Play Mode tokens?

No. Play Mode tokens are for simulation and social ranking purposes only. They
cannot be exchanged for money.

### How do I delete my account?

You can delete your account directly from the **Profile > Settings** menu in the
app.
