system, your access times, and the pages you have viewed directly before and
after accessing the App.

**2.3. Financial Data.** **For "Play Mode" users:** We do NOT collect or store
credit card numbers or banking information, as Play Mode is a free-to-play
simulation. **For Payment Features (if applicable):** Financial data related to
payments is processed and stored by our third-party payment processor (Stripe).
We do not store full credit card numbers on our servers.

**2.4. Mobile Device Access.** We may request access or permission to certain

codes/profile photos) and photo library. If you wish to change our access or
permissions, you may do so in your device’s settings.

Having accurate information about you permits us to provide you with a smooth,
efficient, and customized experience. We may use information collected about you
via the App to:

## 4. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION

We do not sell your personal data. We may share information we have collected
about you in certain situations:

**4.1. By Law or to Protect Rights.** If we believe the release of information
about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy
potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and
safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any
applicable law, rule, or regulation.

**4.2. Third-Party Service Providers.** We may share your information with third

transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.

## 6. POLICY FOR CHILDREN

We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age
of 13. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age
13, please contact us using the contact information provided below. Given the
nature of prediction markets, we generally restrict the App to users aged
**17+** in accordance with App Store guidelines.

## 7. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track
("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference
not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected.
No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has
been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or
any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be
tracked online.

You may at any time review or change the information in your account or
terminate your account by:

requirements.
